    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>How often are prices updated?</h3>
    <p>We review and update prices regularly, but deals can change quickly. Always verify the current price before purchasing.</p>
    
    <h3>Do you ship products?</h3>
    <p>No — we're a curated listing site. All purchases are made through our retail partners.</p>
    
    <h3>How do you choose which drives to list?</h3>
    <p>We focus on price-per-GB value, reliability data (Backblaze stats, user reviews), and use-case appropriateness. We prioritize drives that offer the best balance of price, performance, and reliability for homelab use.</p>
    
    <h3>I found a better deal. Will you list it?</h3>
    <p>Maybe! Send us the details and we'll take a look. We focus on reputable sellers and reliable products, not just the absolute cheapest price.</p>
